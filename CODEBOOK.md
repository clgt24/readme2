# Code Book

The README.md does say:

    GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available
    codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries
    calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

But I think given the description for code book given
[here](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) I have to consider it
missing.

The term "code book" is new to me too. We've been given code books to
describe the datasets for many of our end-of-week assignments in PDF
format. I was able to find a small example for reference
[here](https://health.ucdavis.edu/cancer/research/sharedresources/biostatistics/pdf/Sample-Code-Book.pdf).

You can see (and probably recall from our recent homework assignments)
the linked code book discusses every single variable in the dataset: a
description, its data type, units where relevant, and a set of accepted
values where applicable. Personally, I think that's *way* too much to expect
for this assignment. The dataset they gave us doesn't even include that much
discussion! But I am looking for a little; a summary description of the tidy
dataset:

* What are its dimensions?
* Which of the columns are categorical? Which are quantitative?
* Where can I [read more](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)?
